			<p>Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway. It's a game where the evolution of 
			each pixel is determined by its surrounding neighbours.</p>
			<p>The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>Any living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours lives.</li>
				<li>Any dead cell with 3 living neighbours becomes a living cell.</li>
				<li>All other living cells that doesn't meet the first rule dies, and any dead cell that doesn't meet the second rule stays dead.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>Most simulations allow the user to select which cells are dead or alive before starting the simulation (which may be implemented at 
			a future time), however this simulation selects the dead or alive cells at random and can be reset with the 'Restart Simulation' button below.</p>
