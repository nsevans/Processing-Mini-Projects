# Processing Mini Projects

This repository has some mini projects created with Processing 3.5.4.  
All projects need Processing to be able to run.

## Sierpinski Triangle
This project was inspired by the numberpphiles video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) and
I tried to understand the concept and create the simulation myself. Once the program is run it has an 
option on the side to increase the number of corners the object has (betweem 3 and 10) and you'll be able to see a bit
of data about what is going on.

## Square Filler
This project was something I think I saw on reddit once, and decidedto give it a go and see if I could figure it out
on my own. The basic idea behind it is that each time a square is drawn, the size of the next square gets smaller, 
but squares can only be drawn in an empty space with no intersections with other squares.
